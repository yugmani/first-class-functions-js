  <h2>First-Class Functions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A Programming language is considered to have First-Class functions support
      when it has no restrictions/limits on how functions can be created or
      used.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em
        >“A programming language is said to have First-class functions when
        functions in that language are treated like any other variable.”</em

    </li>
    <li>
      In general, programming languages impose restrictions on the ways in which
      computational elements can be manipulated. Elements with the fewest
      restrictions are said to have first-class status.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Rights and Priviledges</strong> of first class elements:
      <ol>
        <li>Can be assigned to regular variables</li>
        <li>Passed as arguments to functions</li>
        <li>Returned as results of functions</li>
        <li>Included in any data structures</li>
      </ol>
