  <h2>First-Class Functions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A Programming language is considered to have First-Class functions support
      when it has no restrictions/limits on how functions can be created or
      used.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em
        >“A programming language is said to have First-class functions when
        functions in that language are treated like any other variable.”</em
      >
      — MDN
    </li>
    <li>
      In general, programming languages impose restrictions on the ways in which
      computational elements can be manipulated. Elements with the fewest
      restrictions are said to have first-class status.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Rights and Priviledges</strong> of first class elements:
      <ol>
        <li>Can be assigned to regular variables</li>
        <li>Passed as arguments to functions</li>
        <li>Returned as results of functions</li>
        <li>Included in any data structures</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Functional Programming</strong> Solving every single problem using
      functions and functions only.
    </li>
    <li>
      When you can treat a function in a programming language as simple as a
      variable, that language would be much more flexible and opens a lot of
      rooms for improvements.
    </li>
    <li>
      Functional Programming will make your code more

        Composable and Readable</strong

      <h3>
        Having first-class functions in a programming language would make it
        possible to have some awesome patterns, such as:
      </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Higher-order functions</strong>: Functions are considered
          higher-order functions when they take functions as arguments, (like
          most Array utilities, .map, .filter, .reduce, .every ) and/or return a
          function as a result (Exactly like makeCounter).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Closures</strong>: A closure is a function returned by a
          “parent” function and has access to the parent function’s internal
          state. Like our previous example of makeCounter.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Currying</strong>: It’s a mechanism of applying the lazy
          evaluation concept.
        </li>
        <li>
          First-class function is not a pattern, it is just a feature in a
          programming language. That feature would allow treating functions
          easily as variables, and moved around without restrictions.
        </li>
        <li>
          This feature would make the language more powerful and FP-ready. Where
          we can be build very powerful utilities using that feature, like
          higher-order functions, closures, currying and more…
